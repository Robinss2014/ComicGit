Description:

ComitGit is a new way to create comic. User can create a new panel by drawing, resizing, tweaking the colors, replacing the background... The main feature of this project is the story-flow, a tree of panels, where each path is a storyline (comic). The story-flow brings the opportunity to create multiple comics with the same beginning.
